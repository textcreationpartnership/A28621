            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe general uſe of Mental Prayer through the Chriſtian World, next to the influence of the Divine Spirit, who is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe and Author of all that is good, oweth very much to the pious labours of thoſe, who in Written Books and Volumes, have treated at large of this holy Exerciſe, of its nature, excellency, and advantages; and have delivered rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for the due performance of it; and withal have ſuggeſted ample matter of Meditation, digeſted into points, and ſet down in order and method: By which means this principal part of Devotion, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult in its ſelf, without the special unction of the Holy Ghoſt hath been wonderfully facilitated, and made familiar to all: Neither are we in
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> deſtitute of theſe helps, having in our own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<hi>Luiz de Puentes, Luiz Granada's,</hi> and <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio Bruno's</hi> Meditations, and ſome others, whoſe pious labours have proved ſingularly beneficial to the Chriſtian World. Yet in regard theſe Authors are either large in themſelves, or have not that ſet and ready di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution for each day in the year, which would be a <pb facs="tcp:98362:3"/>riddance of a continual trouble in ſeeking out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving Meditations ſuitable to the current time and day; and becauſe many there are, who, though deſirous to employ themſelves daily in this Exerciſe, yet have not either will, or leaſure to spend much time therein, or convenience to have always about them larger Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; I thought it would not prove a ſuperfluous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to adjoyn to the former helps ſome more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and methodical ſupply; which I hope will be ſo performed by this ſhort Journal, that young beginners may find what help they deſire without tediouſneſs, and others that have had more practice in Mental Prayer, and deſire to employ more time therein, may not want matter to work upon, and dilate themſelves more at large, both in diſcourſe and affection.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Journal is of our own Nation, and yet living, though buried to the World, whoſe modesty enjoyns me to a concealment of his name: But in regard the reputation of my Author may be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to the benefit of my Reader, I think my ſelf bound to let the world know that his ſingular vertue and abilities have firſt placed, and ſince fixed him theſe last twenty years in an eminent employment, and one of greateſt truſt in the state and profeſſion he liveth in. He wrote this Book thirty years ſince in Latine, for the benefit of a private Community, of whoſe spiritual advancement, then committed to his charge he was zealous. This work, though never yet ſet forth to the publick view of the world in Print, hath a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient approbation from the general eſteem of all thoſe that have made uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Some perſons of known vertue, literature, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, have procured themſelves Copies, and make uſe of no other in their daily exerciſe of Mental Prayer. Others have taken the pains to Tranſcribe it for their conſtant uſe; and both theſe, and ſeveral others have wiſhed to ſee it publiſhed in Engliſh, for the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <pb facs="tcp:98362:3"/>benefit of our Nation. The matter is ſolid, and for the most part grounded on Divine Scripture, and fitly accommodated to the uſe and practice of the Church, which in ſeveral parts of the year doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us the ſeveral Mysteries of our Saviours Incarnation, his Infancy, Life and Doctrine, his Paſſion and Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. The Method is pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and eaſie, laying down in order each days Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and requiring no further trouble, than the going continually on with them; or if you chance to make any interruption for weeks or days, you need but turn to the week and day you are in, according to the Eccleſiastical account, which every Calendar will tell you.</p>
            <p>As concerning the Tranſlation, I have been faithful in my trust, keeping touch all along with the ſenſe of the Original: What alterations I have made, I was neceſſitated unto, by reaſon of the matter, which being in many places applied by the Author to the particular Community, for which he wrote, required ſome change for the more general uſe of all; and I was authorized therein by an expreſs, and large Commiſſion from the Author; which notwithstanding I have uſed sparingly. As for the Verſion of the Scripture-Text, I have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſought out each Citation, and even ſcrupulouſly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed every where the Rhemes Testament, reverencing and preferring the publick authority of thoſe learned and grave Authors, before that of any private perſon, much more of my own Judgement &amp; opinion. I have alſo for the readier uſe and ſatisfaction of ſuch as may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or deſire to ſee the Citations in the Text it ſelf, noted every where not onely the Chapter, but Verſe alſo, and by this diligent ſearch have corrected very many falſe quotations, cauſed by the ſeveral tranſcriptions of Copies. As for the Citations of Holy Fathers and other Authors, not having convenience of Books to look them out, I have left them as I found them.</p>
            <p>Having thus (Christian Reader) given you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:98362:4"/>of this Journal, and its Tranſlation, I leave it in your hands, and recommend it to your ſerious peruſal. If perhaps your neceſſary occaſions and employments, or little practiſe, or apprehenſion of difficulty in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize of Mental Prayer, permit not any longer or more ſtudious Meditation, at least take the pains to read every day one of theſe pages, and for the space of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, either ſitting or walking, onely to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>OUr chief intent in this Journal, is to ſuggeſt certain brief heads or points of Meditation, for the benefit of ſuch as being deſirous to ſpend ſome ſhort time daily in the exerciſe of Mental Prayer, have not leaſure to peruſe, nor convenience to have ſtill about them larger Volumes.</p>
               <p>We have aſſigned to every day in the year its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Meditation; wherefore if at any time there chance to be more Meditations, than days that year; As for example, before <hi>Advent,</hi> or
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> or then there are weeks after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or
<hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> thoſe that are over and above, are to be omitted that year.</p>
               <p>As to the Method, we have for the moſt part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Abridgement of <hi>F. Lewis</hi> of <hi>Puente</hi> his Meditations. Wherefore we have taken our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Purgative way, employing the Month of
<hi>November</hi> in the conſideration of our End, of Sin, of Death, of Judgement, of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and of Hell; yet ſo, that it be free for every one either to aſſume theſe for this Month, or to continue on according to the day and week after <pb facs="tcp:98362:5"/>
                  <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which he is in, till
<hi>Advent.</hi> Front <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> to <hi>Septuageſme</hi> Sunday (to conform our ſelves, what we can, to the uſe and practice of the Church) we treate of the Incarnation, Nativity, and Infancy of Chriſt, which appertain to the Illuminative way. From <hi>Septuageſme</hi> to <hi>Eaſter,</hi> we comtemplate the Paſſion: Thence again we treat of the ſeveral Apparitions of our Lord, of Gods divine benefits, and of other Myſteries proper to feaſts which occur at that time: All which appertain to the Unitive way. And laſtly, from the third Sunday after <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> we proſecute the reſt of our Saviours Life and Preaching, till <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon every Sunday and Solemne Feaſt, that hath a determinate fixed place in this our diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have endeavored to comply with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral devotion towards the Bleſſed Sacrament, and therefore have inſtituted on thoſe days a Meditation of Holy Communion; taking out of the Goſpel of the day (excepting the Sundays of <hi>November,</hi> the which, as ſuch, have no certain Goſpel) ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, under which we may conſider Chriſt in the Euchariſt, much after the manner wherein
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Molina, Alvarez de Paez,</hi> and others conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; now as a King, now as a Gueſt, Spouſe, Phyſitian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Meditations we have prefixed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous Reflection, that is, ſome Verſicle taken out of Scripture, for every one to entertain his thoughts withall, while he awaketh from ſleep, and clotheth himſelf; that he may the better be diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, whom he is to receive that day.</p>
               <p>Although our intended brevity will not admit of any long diſcourſe, yet we cannot omit to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly in this place concerning Meditation, for the neceſſary information of thoſe who are leſſe converſant in this Exerciſe. If any deſire further <pb facs="tcp:98362:5"/>inſtruction in this point, they may receive full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by reading <hi>F.

               <p>Meditation is nothing elſe but an exerciſe of the Interiour Powers of our Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Memory, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Will; whereby we conſider God, and the Myſteries of our Faith, entertaining our ſelves in affectuous diſcourſes with his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; begging of him his gifts, and negotiating with him the main affair of our ſalvation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

               <p>The firſt, is the exerciſe of our Memory, wherby after we have placed our ſelves in the preſence of God, we ſet before us the Myſtery whereon we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Meditate, divided into points, exerciſing our ſelves in lively acts of Faith concerning the ſame Myſtery, without which all our Meditation will be cold and languiſhing, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet, <hi>If you will not believe,</hi>

               <p>The third conſiſteth in the motion of the Will, conformably to what the Underſtanding had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted unto it, ſo as to produce ſeveral acts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <pb facs="tcp:98362:6"/>ſome in order to one ſelf, others in order to God; as of Love, Confidence, Gratitude, Sorrow, Hatred, Confuſion, Deſire of our ſpiritual progreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the proper effects and end of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>The fourth conſiſteth in demanding of God ſuch things, as by Meditation we underſtand to be neceſſary for us, which we perform by preſenting our requeſt by ſome Colloquie to the Bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, either ſeverally to one, or more Perſon; or generally to all, as the preſent matter may require, or our affection ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>In all Meditation are neceſſary certain Preambles, which do help, and as it were open the way, and enterance into the matter we are about to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate. We ſhould have aſſigned proper Preambles to each Meditation, but becauſe that could not ſtand with our intended brevity, we have thought fit to ſet down in this place ſomething of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="preambles" type="part">
               <head>Of Preambles.</head>
               <p>In all Meditation are neceſſary at leaſt two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles. The firſt is called Compoſition of place. The ſecond is the imploring of Divine Light or Grace.</p>
               <p>Compoſition of Place, is nothing but a certain imaginary repreſentation of the Perſons, Places, and other objects which we are to meditate on, as if we did ſee them with our eyes. For example, If your Meditation be of our Lords Nativity, for the firſt Preamble imagine your ſelf to ſee the Cave, or Stable lying open to the Winds; the Crib, or Manger, wherein the Bleſſed Infant lyeth; the Bleſſed Virgin, and St.
<hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtanding by, and <pb facs="tcp:98362:6"/>the like. If your Meditation be of Death, ſet before your eyes a ſick man lying on his death bed, given over by the Phyſitians, oppreſſed with grief and pain; if it be of Hell, imagine ſome frightful, and hideous dungeon, dark, ſtincking, darting out fiery flames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo of others.</p>
               <p>But if your Meditation be not of any corporeal thing, or ſubject to ſenſe: As for example, of the Attributes of God, of the grievouſneſs of Sin, and the like; and there occur not any fitter, or more proper Preamble, for a general Preamble in all ſuch matters, imagine your ſelf before the Throne of the Divine Majeſty as a poor beggar asking an almes, to wit, that by his grace you may employ that half hour, or hour, in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things conducing to your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Preamble is generally every where the ſame, to wit, the imploring of Divine Light and grace, that you may come to underſtand, and love as you ought the good, and deteſt and avoid the evil which you are to meditate on, according to the diverſity of the matter.</p>
               <p>Entering therefore into Meditation, place your ſelf firſt with all humility in the preſence of God, imagining that Chriſt expects you there, ready to give you audience; then kneeling down with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence, ſay that ſhort Preparatory prayer of the Church, <hi>Prevent we beſeech thee, O Lord, our actions, by thy Spirit aſſiſting us, and in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſecute them, that all our prayer and work may begin always from thee, and begun, by thee may be ended. Through Chriſt our Lord, Amen,</hi> or ſome other like: Then make uſe of the firſt Preamble of Compoſition of Place; and that being done, beg of Almighty God grace ſuitable to the ſubject of your preſent Meditation. After this enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the points or matter of your Meditation, which <pb facs="tcp:98362:7"/>muſt be prepared before hand, and diſcourſe upon them with your underſtanding, examining with your ſelf who, what, where, by what means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in what manner, when, and other general cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that offer themſelves, and in all of them procure, now and then, to ſtir up your will by pious Affections and Colloquies, as often as there ſhall be occaſion: in which Affections and Colloquies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief fruit of prayer doth conſiſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will treat of them in this place more at large.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="colloquies" type="part">
               <head>Of Colloquies.</head>
               <p>Colloquies are to be made as well through the whole courſe, as at the end of Meditation; to wit, as often as the will is ſtirred up to love or hate; to proſecute, or to fly what is ſet before it, according as it is informed by the underſtanding of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or malice of the object: And becauſe we may divers ways conceive God in relation to our ſelves, therefore the Colloquies are to be made, ſometimes as of a Subject to his Prince, ſometimes as of a Child to his Father; at other times again as of the Spouſe to her Beloved, of Friend to Friend, of a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to his Judge,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> now begging ſomething, now admiring, now offering, now congratulating, now, condoling, as the preſent matter ſhall require.

Mankind lived in baniſhment out of Paradiſe, ſhut out of Heaven, made ſlave of the Devil and enemy to God, and lay wallowing from one ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, to be caſt at length headlong into Hell fire: neither did there appear any means poſſible of appeaſing the Divine Juſtice, being no pure creature could make is any ſatifaction.</p>

Chriſt was not ſubject to the law of Circumciſion, as being incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Original Sin, whoſe remedy it was: He would notwithſtanding undergo it, though moſt painful. 1. To honour the Law in his own Perſon. 2. Not to offend others by his ſingularity. 3. That he might ſoon begin to ſhed his bloud for us. 4. That having taken upon himſelf our ſins, he might alſo undergo the penalty. 5. To give us example of Obedience to the law of God; of contempt of all worldly reputation; and of mortifying our ſelves. Learn to do even what you are not obliged unto, and to ſeek the mortification of your fleſh;

Think how derogatory this was to the dignity of the Son of God, how full of inconvenience: Thus God dealeth with them whom he loveth beſt. Are you greater, or better then the Son of God? why then do you complain when he permits you to ſuffer ſome hardſhips? Take theſe as tokens of his love, and you will bear them the better, and that with joy and thanks too.</p>
               <p>Conſider 2.

Their religious obſeruance towards God, and his laws, as much as the condition of baniſhment in a Heatheniſh country would permit. 2. Their Charity and Union among themſelves. 3. Their extrem poverty, having noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but what they got by labour of their hands to maintain themſelves and the Child. 4. Their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in the ill uſages of the Egyptians. 5.

He took upon him our infirmities and miſeries, not by conſtraint, or neceſſity, but out of pure love both to ſatisfy for us, and to teach us by his own example all manner of Vertue. Return therefore love for love.

Wherefore it hath ſeemed good from thence to enter into the Meditations of the Paſſion, wherein, though many affections may be exerciſed for the Colloquies, as appeareth by what hath been ſaid in the Preface, yet chiefly ſeven are noted by ſome as moſt proper to this Subject; the which becauſe we can not with our intended brevity inſert in every Meditation, we have thought good to touch them briefly in this place.

There having now paſſed time ſufficient to evidence the certainty of his death, on the third day, early in the morning, our Lord haſtened to bring forth the Holy Fathers our of Limbus, to comfort his B. Mother, and deſolate Diſciples, and Illuſtrate the whole world with the rayes of his glory. What Jubily were the Holy Fathers in at that time, when they ſaw that Bleſſed hour come of their delivery, which they had longed for, ſo many ages? Free, O Lord, in like manner my Soul from the Lions mouth, and from the deep lake, and let not my Enemies, The World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, ever domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere over me.</p>
               <p>Conſider 2.

Then he reunited it to the Soul, and that of David was fullfilled,
<hi>Our Lord hath reigned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 92.1.</note> 
                  <hi>he hath put on beauty; Our Lord hath put on ſtrength, and hath girded himſelf.</hi> For he took upon him the four properties of a glorifyed body. 1.

The manner wherewith Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed you from the ſaid ſlavery: With good reaſon <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>With him is plenteous Redemption;</hi> for he could by his abſolute power have remitted all our ſins, without taking mans fleſh upon him: He might alſo have ſatisfied the rigour of Juſtice by the leaſt action of his, after his Incarnation; but would ſuffer ſo much, that <hi>where ſin abounded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.20</note>
                  <hi>grace might more abound:</hi> and that he might leave us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, according to S. Peter,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21</note>

               <p>Conſider 2. More in particular what he ſuffered. In the Manger, in his Circumciſion, in his flight, and in <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf; by hunger and thirſt, by cold and nakedneſs, by much travelling, and frequent <pb n="250" facs="tcp:98362:139"/>dangers. Laſtly, during the time of his Paſſion, by his ſcourging at the Pillar, by the crowning with Thorns, and nailing on the Croſs: and all this he ſuffered for his Enemies; that is, for all ſinners. Who did ever ſuffer ſo much even for his friends? Wherefore the Church on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve breaketh forth into thoſe admirable notes; <hi>O happy fault, which deſerved to have ſuch,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The Manna was bread, but without ſeed, or tillage; not growing out of the earth, but coming down from heaven: So the H. Euchariſt; <hi>This is the bread that came down from heaven:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. 6.58.</note> And the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body of Chriſt, which is contained therein, proceeded not by humane generation, but from the Virgin alone, and by the divine influence of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

<hi>Nicodemus</hi> being a prime man, and well skilled in the Law, came to Chriſt for inſtruction; but in the night time, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in regard of his worldly reputation, being aſhamed, perhaps, to appear amongſt the poor and unlearned Diſciples: Think how many are hindered from their Salvation, by theſe worldly reſpects; but do you rather ſay with S. Paul, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel;</hi> and confeſs God both confidently and openly; <hi>For he that ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, him the ſon of man ſhall be aſhamed of,</hi>

               <p>Conſider 2. Chriſt, as a moſt loving Phyſitian, accommodated himſelf to the weakneſs of this Diſciple, and inſtructed him in many things. 1. Concerning Baptiſme. 2. Of the cauſes of his coming into the world. 3. Of his Paſſion that was to enſue. 4. Of Faith neceſſary to ſalvation. Give God thanks for theſe, and ponder in particular the <pb n="335" facs="tcp:98362:181"/>benefit of our Spiritual Generation by Baptiſme: <hi>You muſt be born again,</hi> &amp;c.

3. He performed alſo the part of a Councellour, exhorting them to points of the greateſt perfection, even beyond the obligation of the Law; as of turning the other cheek to the ſtriker, of letting go the Cloak alſo to him that takes away the Coat, of going two other miles with him that will force you one mile, and the like.

               <p>COnſider 1. With what pomp and ſtate, of Plate, Perfumes, Tapiſtry, and other rich Furniture, worldly Princes are wont to ſet forth their Bed-chamber, and Rooms of Preſence; How much more fitting was it, that the King of Heaven ſhould adorn the Cabin, wherein he was not only to abide for ſome time, but of which he decreed to frame himſelf a Body. To be Mother of God, is the greateſt Dignity that can poſſibly be communicated to a pure creature: To her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are due all manner of Grace, and Ornaments, which by the ordinary Power of God, may be conferred upon any pure Creature: Therefore S.

                  <hi>It was fitting that the Virgin ſhould be adorned with that Purity, then the which, no greater, under God, could be conceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider 2. Hence it followeth, that whatſoever Internal Grace and Virtue was beſtowed upon <pb n="467" facs="tcp:98362:247"/>any Saint, the ſame in a much more perfect manner was conferred upon the B. Virgin: And which is more, divers Authors affirm,<note place="margin">Suar. 3. <hi>p.t.</hi>

               <p>Conſider 3. What Reverence, Confidence, and Love you ought hence to have towards this Sacred Virgin: Reverence, for the Excellency of her Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Confidence, for the greatneſs of her Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Love, for the tender bowels of her Charity towards us: For ſhe vouchſafeth to be a Mother to us all; and the greater ſhe is, the more tender ſhe is of us: what might you not hope for, if you had a Mother that were Empreſs of the whole world? Love therefore, that you may deſerve to be loved, and protected by ſo powerful a Lady.</p>

               <p>COnſider 1. How true is that ſaying of the Church: <hi>Your Nativity, O Mother of God, hath brought joyful tidings to the whole world,</hi> &amp;c. For 1.

Angels, though in number almoſt infinite, are commonly divided into <pb n="473" facs="tcp:98362:250"/>nine Quires, and three Hierarchies: In the firſt are the Cherubins, Seraphins, and Thrones: The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins property is to be inflamed with the love of God, and to enkindle the ſame in others: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins excel in Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, and with the ſame do enlighten the inferiour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: The Thrones are ſo called, for that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſingular Purity, Humility, and Juſtice, God doth particularly reſide in them as his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Throne. Apply all this to your ſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be a Cherubin in Love, a Seraphin in the Knowledge of God, and of heavenly things, and a Throne in Purity of Life, in Humility, and Juſtice towards God and Man.</p>

Virginity, although it be a ſpecial gift of God, is not beſtowed without our concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor conſerved without diligent care; for <hi>we have this treaſure in Earthen Veſſels.</hi> The means therefore to obtain and conſerve it are 1. Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Fleſh by Faſting, Abſtinence, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Corporal Auſterities. 2. Strict guard upon our Senſes, which are the gates through which all evil doth enter into our Soul. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over our thoughts, neither admitting, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven diſputing with any that are againſt this Virtue. 4. The avoiding of all occaſions that may bring us into the leaſt danger. 5. Earneſt Prayer to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, whoſe gift it is. 6. Humility, not truſting <pb n="487" facs="tcp:98362:257"/>to our ſelves, knowing our own weakneſs. 7. Fear of God. 8. Memory of the laſt things.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 14.4 </note>Conſider 3. The Reward of Virginity. 1. It is ſufficient Reward to it ſelf, freeing the Soul from the Tyranny of the Fleſh, and unruly Paſſions, to which others are ſubject, and filling the ſame with moſt pure joy, and content, above all the delights of the World. 2. Virgins after a ſpecial manner are Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and Spouſes of Chriſt, with whom he delighteth to be: Whence they have that ſingular Prerogative above others in Heaven, that
<hi>they follow the Lamb whither ſoever he ſhall go.</hi> 3. They have a ſpecial Crown in Heaven, like to that of Martyrs: And S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth ſtile Virginity, the Mother of Martyrs, and a glorious Martyrdome it ſelf. Stir your ſelf up to the love of this Heavenly and Angelical Virtue, and make uſe of the means that help to obtain it.</p>

            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth:</hi> Chriſt had this Power: 1. As God, from all Eternity. 2. As Man, in the very inſtant of his Incarnation, by right of the Hypoſtatical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 3. Through the Merit of his Paſſion and Death, as to the perfect uſe and exerciſe of it. Hence it followeth, that we have a Triple Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb facs="tcp:98362:271"/>of ſerving him. 1. As our God, by his Deity. 2. As the Sovereign Lord, and Head of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by his Incarnation. 3. As our Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, by his Death and Paſſion: He hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Power to the full for your good: See that you fulfill your duty in ſerving him.</p>
            <p>Conſider 2. <hi>Going therefore teach ye all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By virtue of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power he doth Authorize and Commiſſion his Diſciples. 1. To go and teach what he had taught them. 2. To Baptize them in the Name of the B. Trinity, that by the benefit of Baptiſm, they might obtain Divine Faith, Remiſſion of their ſins, Grace, and Everlaſting Glory. 3. To deliver unto them Chriſts new Law, Precepts, and Councels, <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider 3. <hi>And behold I am with you all daies, even to the conſummation of the world:</hi> Chriſt is with us: 1. As God, by his Immenſity. 2. As God and Man, by his Preſence in the H. Euchariſt. 3. By Habitual and Actual Grace, enabling us to act Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally, in order to our End. 4. By a ſpecial Providence, governing and directing every one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the attaining to the perfection of their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 5. After a ſpecial manner he is with the whole Church, and principle Members thereof, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting them with his Divine Wiſdom, and Veracity, in their Councels, and Definitions, Interpretation of Scriptures, and Government; and arming them with his Omnipotent Power againſt Perſecutions, Hereſie, and Infidelity; ſo that the Gates of Hell ſhall not be able to prevail againſt them. Be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for theſe benefits, and endeavour to be always preſent with him in mind and affection.</p>
